    "The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console when the code is executed, and they will appear in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(1) is executed first, so it logs 1 to the console immediately. This happens synchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0) is executed next. Even though the timeout is set to 0 milliseconds, the callback function is still queued to be executed in the event loop after the current synchronous execution completes. So, 3 is not logged immediately but will be logged after the other synchronous tasks finish executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(4) is the next synchronous statement, so it logs 4 to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000) is executed. This sets a timeout of 1000 milliseconds, so the callback function will be placed in the event loop queue to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. Since there are no other synchronous tasks pending, the event loop will pick up the setTimeout callback, and 2 will be logged to the console.\n",

    "So, the final output will look like this:\n"
